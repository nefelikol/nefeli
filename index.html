      <h3>Nefeli-Maria Kollia</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Hi! I am a 5th year undergrad student at National Technical University of Athens, <a href="https://www.arch.ntua.gr/?lang=en" target="_blank">School of Architecture</a>. This is the website I created for <a href="https://www.arch.ntua.gr/index.php/did_katefthinsi/information-technology/?lang=en" target="_blank">ARCH 4342 Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences</a>. This project was made using the template given from the professor collocating with previous basic knowledge on html (high school projects on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">codecacademy.com</a>). Through this course I would like to know more about programming in p5.js, html and css and to condine those to make a website for my architecture portfolio. Here is a list of my projects. Have a look! </p>

        <h5>Project No.1</h5>
        <p>In this project I created a code that described the process of making bead set of earings.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="pink project" class="four columns">

        <h5><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/nefeli_maria_kollia/sketches/RLhdXZbAA" target="_blank">Project No.2</a></h5>
        <p>In this project I created a code in p5.js that creates ellipses in random coordinates across the canvas with diferent radius and colors. An interesting things is that I incorporated a conditional that clears the canvas and changes the background color, so every now and then a new piece of art is created!</p>

        <p>In this project I created a code that draws lines across the width of the canvas with random dolor and angle. An interesting thing is that I incorporated a conditional that clears the canvas and changes the background color, so every now and then a new piece of art is created!</p>

        <h5><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/nefeli_maria_kollia/sketches/RQarQiN52" target="_blank">Project No.4</a></h5>
        <p>In this project I created a code that makes a tile-like grid with a variety of rectangles and blue values. An interesting thing is that by clicking in a rectanles you can change it's color to red. </p>

      <div id="brown project" class="four columns">
        <img src="images/pac man.png" class ="scale-with-grid">
        <h5><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/nefeli_maria_kollia/sketches/cSwed1qPD" target="_blank">Pac-Man</a></h5>
        <p>In this project i tried to make a simplified version of the all time clasic pac-man arcade. A pac-man is created in his game with the black background and the walls, but the food and the ghosts are not incorparated.</p>

      <p> In this team project the team created a digital 3d lanscape. The purpose of this lanscape is to the observer about the temperatures in 41 countries in Europe, by creating a 3d diagramm that indicates the average, minimym and maximum tempratures of those countries for 12 months. This theermo-scape is gooing to be part of an installation and the visitor will have the opportunity to interact with it.</p>
